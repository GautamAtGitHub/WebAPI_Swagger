# WebAPI_Swagger

Swagger is the worldâ€™s largest framework of API developer tools for the OpenAPI Specification(OAS), enabling development across the entire API lifecycle, from design and documentation, to test and deployment.

OpenAPI is the specification, and Swagger is a set of tools that facilitate the implementation.
